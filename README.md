# CO224 Computer Architecture
## Building a simple processor
Design and development of an 8 bit single cycle processor with ALU, a register file, and control logic using Verilog HDL.

## How to run the program
1. Compile
    - iverilog -o cpu_tb.vvp cpu_tb.v
2. Run
    - vvp cpu_tb.vvp
3. GTKwave
    - gtkwave cpu_wavedata.vcd
